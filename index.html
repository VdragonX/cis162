<header><h2>Welcome</h2></header>

<p>  I am Victor Perez Garcia, a student at Cerritos college for the
     Spring 2025 semester in CIS 162.I started college with the idea
     of majoring in some type of nursing field, but after sometime in 
     college i have found myself liking something more in the CIS field.
     My true passion is for music and the arts, but anything tech related comes a close second.
     The most experience I have in CIS is the previous classes I took at Cerritos College and
     Amazon Web Services at my current job. I hope to earn an AA degree in a CIS related field with some certifications and maybe
     transfer to a four-year university to earn a bachelors degree. </p>

<ol>
    <li>love going to the cinemas to catch up on new films or watching some movies at home that I missed</li>
    <li>I enjoy experiencing being a foodie and trying new spots I see on Tiktok or Youtube.</li>
    <li>Live music is what i live for. When possible I try and go to as many live music shows as I can, whether small or big artists. It is always a fun experience.</li>
</ol>
<p>
     My favorite website is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> because there is so much content to choose from, like music, comedy, and education.
